# Solvent Accessable surface area


    Developed Python script to analyze ASA files containing protein and RNA structural data, ensuring data integrity and avoiding corruption errors.

    Calculated interface area by comparing protein and RNA atomic surface accessibility (ASA) values, identifying atoms with positive differences indicative of interface interactions.

    Implemented residue-level analysis to determine the number of interacting residues in both protein and RNA structures, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of molecular interactions.

    Generated output files ('1asy_P.int' and '1asy_R.int') containing interface data, and summarized results including interface area, number of interface atoms, and interacting residues for both protein and RNA structures.
